# DeepPipe: Deep Pipeline Embeddings for AutoML

*DeepPipe* efficiently optimizes Machine Learning Pipelines using meta-learning. For detailed information, refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14009) *Deep Pipeline Embeddings for AutoML* accepted at KDD 2023. Additionally, you can visit our [blog-post](https://releaunifreiburg.github.io/deepppipe/) to have a friendly insight on how our method works.

## Installation

We present an API for optimizing pipelines in scikit-learn based on the TensorOboe search space. You can use it to search for accurate pipelines or for benchmarking your Machine Learning model on tabular data. 

```bash
conda create -n deeppipe_env python==3.9
conda activate deeppipe_env
pip install deeppipe_api==0.1.4
```

## Getting started

We present an example using an OpenML dataset. However, it works with any tabular data typed as pandas dataframe. 


```python
from deeppipe_api.deeppipe import load_data, openml, DeepPipe

task_id = 37
task = openml.tasks.get_task(task_id)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data(task, fold=0)
deep_pipe = DeepPipe(n_iters = 50,  #bo iterations
                    time_limit = 3600 #in seconds
                    )
deep_pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = deep_pipe.predict(X_test)

#Test
score = deep_pipe.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Test acc.:", score)

#print best pipeline
print(deep_pipe.model)
```
**Note**: When comparing with other AutoML optimizers have in mind that the search space might differ.

### Ensemble of Pipelines

It is possible to ensemble the best pipelines, by using a greedy approach. 


```python
from deeppipe_api.deeppipe import load_data, openml, DeepPipe

task = openml.tasks.get_task(task_id=37)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data(task, fold=0)
deep_pipe = DeepPipe(n_iters = 50,  #bo iterations
                    time_limit = 3600, #in seconds
                    create_ensemble = False,
                    ensemble_size = 10,
                    )
deep_pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = deep_pipe.predict(X_test)
score = deep_pipe.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Test acc.:", score) 
```
